I am still going to keep this repo because it is history 


### Edit by Bella:

To clarify for whoever in the future is looking at this: this is a fork of my fork, [S-B99/kamiblue](https://github.com/S-B99/kamiblue) (https://blue.bella.wtf if repo link changes)

Finz0 got mad after TigerMouthBear (relevant person who continued Ares client and helped with Backdoored client) created this issue: https://github.com/FINZ0/Osiris/issues/55

So now the original repo is private.

It is perfectly legal to release this code as it is licensed under LGPL, as described and fixed in this pull request which was merged: https://github.com/FINZ0/Osiris/pull/48 (https://web.archive.org/web/20200229132930/https://github.com/FINZ0/Osiris/pull/48)

Osiris discord acknowledging that it has been privated:
